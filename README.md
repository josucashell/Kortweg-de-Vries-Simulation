# Kortweg-de-Vries-Simulation
The code is separated into two files. Soliton.py is where the testing and all the plots are produced. PDE_solver.py is where my class is made that solves the PDE.
The Soliton.py file is made so that each cell produces a plot from the report. At the beginning there is a simulation that is there just to provide reference of how to start a simulation.
